# AndroidOverlayEffects
An overlay app (draw on other apps) that can draw particle effects on the translucent screen


Future plans:
- different effects
- some physics
- cool wheel widget to select the different effects
- maybe analyizing the current screen capture and interact with the current android screen (would take a lot of figuring out since it is not possible for the app to understand what are the background elements. maybe some Image analysis process is have to be done)
